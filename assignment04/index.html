        <p>hi there my name is madison and i am 20. in this website i am going to write lts of things about myself so that you can see my sick sticky nav bar. here are some fun facts- i love nicki minaj, if i were a bird i would be a cardinal, my middle name is maria (its pronounced mariah), my favorite color is silver, i like cows, i am writing this while in a meeting, i am wearing a plaid shirt, i have 2 roommates, today i went to target, if i were a store i would be target. my new favorite game is to ask people what they would be if they were something, it is super fun and you should definitely try it. </p>
